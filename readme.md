## Get Started

Buchta is under renovation, sorry<br>
<br>

# Changes v3 -> v4

## Performane

Returning simple 'hi': <br>
v3: 59k req/s<br>
v4: 106k reqs<br>
<br>
Parsing params and query: <br>
v3: 49k req/s<br>
v4: 90k req/s<br>
<br>
Parsing and returning the same json: <br>
v3: 52k req/s<br>
v4: 72k req/s<br>

## BuchtaRequest
BuchtaRequest is gone, `request` is casual `Request` with `params` and `query` added to it

## Something else?
Yes, many things are still being implemented so until that, I won't update npm package
